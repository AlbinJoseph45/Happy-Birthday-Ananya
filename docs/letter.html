            Ananya,<br><br>

            I know your love towards the physical letters. But, please accept this digital letter which is my way. <br><br>

            I'm really out of words to express what I feel when I'm with you. I'll call it the super comfort I ever got in my life.
            Literally I don't know how to thank you or how to give it back. Sometimes, I even think do I deserve this much love or not. 
            Anyway I'm so much blessed to be with you. I don't know, it might be a short beautiful chapter in my life. 
            I know, you have a lot of confusions with me. But, I assure I'll try to keep our bond forever atleast as a come back place for both.<br><br>

            Sometimes, I felt tired and even got mad which is true, but I always I choose to came back to you only.
            I like to utilize this beautiful occasion to apologize for every wrong action/word from me that hurt you.<br><br>

            <b>Wrapping with some good words:</b><br>
            You are the calm in my chaos,
            the moon in my darkest nights,
            the warmth in my coldest days. <br>

            I feel like home each moment with you. 🌙<br>
            I choose you — every day, every time.
        </p>
